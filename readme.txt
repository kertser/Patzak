General Idea:
Make a deivece, based on RPi0 to detect face, build features and classify the face to match one of the previously
trained groups.

- We will test the fastest algoritms for face detection and feature recognition (openCV is too large for Pi-Zero)
- We will construct the classifier, based on unsupervised learning algorithm (KNN? SVM?)
- We will implement the program into the electronic device (RPi0)
